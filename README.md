# MinecraftAFKDigispark
A simple arduino sketch for a digispark that can mine mob farms or auto fishers

This sketch, when burned onto a digispark will alternate between power cycles between emulating a mouse left clicking every 1 second and a mouse holding the right click. This is useful for attackng mobs at a farm with left click or fishing at an auto fisher with right click.
